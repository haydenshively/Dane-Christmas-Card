# Dane's Christmas Card

Uses the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library to create a quick little racing game. I created all graphics seen in the project.  
  
## Instructions

Tap to swim. If the dolphin starts pulling ahead, your swim speed will be increased to make winning easier. If you want to try again, shake your device to start over (only works on mobile devices).
